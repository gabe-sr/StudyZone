# Data Structures & Algorithms

### Purpose:

This directory is destined to contain all code + explanations of various data structures.

At first the I will be using [OpenDSA](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA)'s materials to study theory, but will develop my own code as if in a college course. Spinning up a simple Docker container 🐳 and doing some WSL config (using linux inside windows) are added bonuses. Clifford A. Schaffer's book is also available [here](https://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/) if needed, even if the author said its **OBSOLETE**, it's still a good resource in a pinch, or through the interwebs [here](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS2/html/).

### Related studies:

> **Maths:** It is probably a good idea to also brush up on mathematic concepts, which I plan to do with MIT's open courseware initiative. The course for this is [Matemathics for Computer Science](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/course/), available on the Open Learning Library.

> **Formal CS Course:** Although I am trying to make this quick and accessible (also easier for me to start this repo), as time goes by I plan to "re-attend" a formal course like Harvard's CS50 on [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) (~~free and~~ with certificate), also available in video form (recorded in 2021) on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710)'s youtube page (there's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4) version fully using Python 🐍). There's also MIT's [intro to algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/pages/syllabus/) course, but I'm trying to restraint myself (this has already gone into a tangent 👀).
