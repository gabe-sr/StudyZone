# Java

## Methodology

at first this file will contain a myriad of notes on various aspects of the language (Java) I encounter along the way, from the very basic to more niche ones, and after some content is input here, I will organize it in a more structured way. I will try to come up with and populate each note with descriptive tags. This is to facilitate organization afterwards

### Unstructured Notes

* Java is a compiled, high level language that runs in its own virtual machine, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes it highly portable, generally if a code is compiled once it can be run in various places, only depending on the JVM version. (t:basic)
* Consensus on variable naming is using camelCase (t:basic)
* Floating point is, as expected, not truly precise due to binary mantissas (repeating fraction) (t:basic)
* *package* is a collection of related classes, a directory where all these classes are located (t:basic)
* Formatting output : | symbol                     | type                                               |
  | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | %d                         | Integer (base 10), decimal                         |
  | %,d                        | Integer with comma separators                      |
  | %08d                       | Integer, padded with 0s at least 8 digits wide     |
  | %f                         | Floating point number                              |
  | %.2f                       | Floating point number, rounded to 2 decimal places |
  | %s                         | String (char array)                                |
  | %x                         | Integer (base 16), hexadecimal                     |
  | -check java.util.Formatter |                                                    |
* java standard array has a *property* that returns the **size** called length, it is not a method.
